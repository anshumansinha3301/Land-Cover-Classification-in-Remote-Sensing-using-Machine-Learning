# Land-Cover-Classification-in-Remote-Sensing-using-Machine-Learning

## Usage
- Run the Python script to generate the synthetic dataset, train models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
- SHAP plots require an active display; run in an environment supporting graphical output for full experience.

## Notes
- The dataset and features are synthetic and simplified for demonstration purposes.
- Model training uses fixed random seeds for reproducibility.
- SHAP explanation is generated on a subset of the test data for faster execution.

## Results
- Accuracy scores for each classifier are printed.
- Feature importance and class distributions are visualized through plots.
- The best model and scaler are saved as `landcover_best_model.pkl` and `feature_scaler.pkl`.
