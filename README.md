# Land-Cover-Classification-in-Remote-Sensing-using-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates a remote sensing geoinformatics application that classifies land cover types using multispectral synthetic satellite data. The dataset simulates spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2), temperature, and elevation for pixels, along with vegetation indices (NDVI and SAVI).
